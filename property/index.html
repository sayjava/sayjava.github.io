                The choice between buying a property and renting one is the biggest financial decisions that
                many of us adults will have to make at some point, But the costs of buying are more complicated and we can do some homework  and check
                if buying is the best decision.

                To help you answer this question,
                the advance mortgage calculator on this page takes the most important costs associated with buying a
                house and compares it to rent a similar apartment using exact same monthly payment and tells your potential net worth when you sell
                the property.

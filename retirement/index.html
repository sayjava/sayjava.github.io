        Terms and Conditions of use of the Risk Profile Questionnaire
        This questionnaire is designed to help you decide how to allocate your assets among different
        asset classes (stocks, bonds). You are under no obligation to accept the suggested allocations
        provided by this questionnaire. This is not an investment advice neither
    </p>
    <p>
        The suggestions provided are based on generally accepted investment principles. There is no
        guarantee,
        however, that any particular asset allocation or mix of funds will meet your investment
        objectives or
        provide you with a given level of retirement income. All investing is subject to risk, and
        fluctuations in the
        financial markets and other factors may cause the value of your
        plan account to decline. Investments in bond funds are subject to interest rate, credit, and
        inflation risk.
    </p>
    <p>
        You should carefully consider all of your options before investing.
    </p>
    <p>
        This investment portfolio can also be used for an ISA (individual savings account) or for a SIPP retirement account
